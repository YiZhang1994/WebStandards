                <h3>The Development of HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create Web pages. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements
                    consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.</p>
                <p><b>HTML1 (1991)</b> does not actually exist. "HTML1" is a name for Tim Berners-Lee's original HTML.
                    These tags are taken from a document titled "HTML Tags”</p>
                <p><b>HTML2.0 (1995-97)</b> is a name for HTML as defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
                <p><b>HTML3.2 (1997)</b> was the first formally approved, industry-wide HTML standard, a W3C Recommendation.</p>
                <p><b>HTML4.0 (1997)</b> was published as a W3C Recommendation. Three variations are offered: strict, transitional and frameset.</p>
                <p><b>HTML4.01 (1999)</b> became a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML4.0. It is the first turning point of HTML development.</p>
                <h3>XHTML</h3>
                <p>XHTML is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used HTML. It is a more restrictive subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).</p>
                <p><b>XHTML1.0 (1998)</b> is based on HTML4, but no new tags or attributes are introduced in this version. The only difference is that XHTML demands strict syntax as XML. For example,
                    HTML4.01 allows both uppercase and lowercase letters, while XHTML only allows lowercase. The second edition of XHTML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in August 2002.</p>
                <p><b>XHTML1.1 (2009-10)</b> evolved out of the work surrounding the initial Modularization of XHTML specification.
                    The first draft was released by W3C in 1999; Recommendation status was reached in 2001.</p>
                <p><b>XHTML2.0 (2002-06)</b> is a new version of XHTML able to make a clean break from the past by discarding
                    the requirement of backward compatibility. Some controversy in the web developer community was caused by its incompatibility with XHTML1.X and HTML4.</p>
                <h3>WHATWG</h3>
                <p>Due to the slow development of W3C and W3C's rejection to HTML in favor of XML-based technologies, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) was founded by individuals from Apple, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software in 2004.
                    WHATWG  proposes a continuous revision strategy that does not use version milestones. It mainly focuses on the development of Web Forms 2.0 and Web Apps 1.0, which are extensions of HTML and together form the HTML5.
                </p>
                <p>While WHATWG focused on HTML5, W3C still continued with XHTML2.0. In 2006, Tim Berners-Lee pointed out
                    that the attempt to switch to XML didn’t work. W3C then formed a new HTML group, learning from the
                    fruit of WHATWG. W3C declared to halter all the developing work of XHTML2 standards in 2009.
                </p>
                <h3>HTML5</h3>
                <p><b>HTML5 (2014)</b> is published by W3C, being the fifth and current version of HTML standards. Many new syntactic features are added and HTML5 extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents.
                    It is also cross-platform supportive. The APIs and DOM now become fundamental parts.</p>
